# Mask_Classifier
During the time of pandemic (Covid-19) wearing mask is must. This classifier will recognize people wearing mask or not for the safety of all. 
Wearing mask can reduce the spread of virus for more than 80 percent.
This classifier is built using CNN and detecting the faces using OpenCV.
During the building, classifier has been trained on 552 train images and tested on 276 images in which the number of people wearing mask is 452 and people not wearing mask is 376.
Accuracy of the model is 95% with the model checkpoint and 65% with the early stopping.
Turn on the webcam or use an external camera source if you want and run the classifier. Check how accurate it is detecting weather you are wearing a mask or not.
We can put a camera on a high place or on pole for the screeing of multiple people moving on roads.
Results can be made better if you increase the number of train/test images and by making some variations.
Grab the code and check it out yourself.
