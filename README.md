# Mask_Classifier

# Introduction
During the time of pandemic (Covid-19) wearing mask is must. This classifier will recognize people wearing mask or not for the safety of all. 
Wearing mask can reduce the spread of virus for more than 80 percent.

# Classifier overview
This classifier is built using CNN and detecting the faces using OpenCV.
During the building, classifier has been trained on 552 train images and tested on 276 images in which the number of people wearing mask is 452 and people not wearing mask is 376.
Accuracy of the model(optimizer = 'adam') is 95% with the model checkpoint and 65% with the early stopping.

# Dataset
Dataset for this model is takken from google images.(Since i'm using less number of images so accuracy may vary but if number of images is increased then it would make the model robust.

# Result
Turn on the webcam or use an external camera source if you want and run the classifier. Check how accurate it is detecting weather you are wearing a mask or not.
We can put a camera on a high place or on pole for the screeing of multiple people moving on roads.
Grab the code and check it out yourself.
